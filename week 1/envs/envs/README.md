# Computer Vision: Environment 

# Setup
- Install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>. We will create our own environment.
- Create a conda environment, using the appropriate command. On Windows, open the installed "Anaconda Prompt" to run this command. On MacOS and Linux, you can just use a terminal window to run the command. Modify the command based on your OS ('linux', 'mac', or 'win'): `conda env create -f environment.yml`
- This should create an environment named `socv`. Activate it using the following Windows command: `conda activate socv` or the following MacOS / Linux command: `source activate socv`.
