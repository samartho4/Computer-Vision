Assignment: Convert a Photo into a Watercolor-Style Artwork using OpenCV
Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to use the OpenCV library in Python to transform a standard photograph into a watercolor-style artwork. This will involve applying image processing techniques such as smoothing, edge detection, and blending, which are commonly used to achieve artistic effects.
step 1: Read and Preprocess the Image:
Choose a photo of your choice and load it into your Python script using the cv2.imread() function.
Resize the image if necessary, to ensure that it fits well on the screen.

Step 2: Removing impurities from image and apply Smoothing Using Edge-Preserving Filter

Step 3: Combine the Effects to Create a Watercolor Look

step 4: Tune the Art
(Tuning may include sharpening, dehazing, contrast enhancement etc )

step 5: Display and Save the Result:
Display both the original image and the final watercolor-style image using cv2.imshow().
Save the output image using cv2.imwrite().

Submission Requirements:
Submit your Python script (.py file) and pdf file with the completed code.
Include the original photo and the generated watercolor-style artwork (.jpg or .png format).
Write a short report (200-300 words) describing the approach, parameters used, and observations made during the process.
